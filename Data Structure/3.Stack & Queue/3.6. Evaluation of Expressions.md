## Evaluation of Expressions (Chapter 3.6)

### 3.6.1 Expressions

- The representation and evaluation of expressions is of great interest to computer scientists.
- Example expressions
  - ((rear + 1 == front) || (( rear == MAX_QUEUE_SIZE-1) && !front))
  - $x=a/b–c+d*e–a*$



- Tokens in expressions
  
  - operators (e.g. $=, /, -, +, *$)
  - operands (e.g. $a, b, c, d, e, x$)
  - parentheses
  
  
  
- Suppose we have the following statement.

  - $x=a/b–c+d*e–a*c$

  

- When a=4,b=2,c=2,d=3,and e=3,what is the value of x?
  - Which one is correct?
     - $((4/2)–2)+(3*3)–(4*2)=0+9–8=1$
     - $(4/(2–2+3))*(3–4)*2=4/3*(-1)*2=-2.666...$
     
     
  
- Within any programming language, there is a precedence hierarchy that **determines the order** in which we evaluate operators.

- Parentheses are used to override precedence, and the expresisons are always evaluated from the innermost parenthesized expression first.

- When two operators of the same precedence appear in an expression, they are evaluated according to the associativity.

- Precedence hierarchy for C

 - Infix notation: a * b

   - (operator is placed between the operands) 


- Prefix notation: * a b

  - (operator is placed before the operands)
  
  
- Postfix notation: a b *

  - (operator is placed after the operands)

  

- Prefix and Postfix notations are parenthesis-freenotations.

- Although infix notation is the most common way of writing expressions, it is not the one used by compilers to evaluate expressions.
- Compilers typically use postfix notation, which is a parenthesis-free notation.

| Infix                | Postfix       |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| 2+3*4                | 234*+         |
| a*b+5                | ab*5+         |
| (1+2)*7              | 1 2+7*        |
| a*b/c                | ab*c/         |
| ((a/(b-c+d))*(e-a)*c | abc-d+/ea-*c* |
| a/b-c+d*e-a*c        | ab/c-de*+ac*- |

### 3.6.2 Evaluating Postfix Expressions

- To evaluate a postfix expression, we make a single left-to-right scan.

  -  Step 1: Place the operands on a stack until we findan operator

  -  Step 2: Remove, from the stack, the correct number of operands for the operator

  -  Step 3: Perform the operation

  -  Step 4: Place the result back on the stack

Infix: $6 / 2 - 3 + 4 * 2 $

Postfix: $6 2 / 3 - 4 2 * +$

- Assumptions

  -  To simplify our task, let us assume that the expression contains only the binary operators: $+, -, *, /, $and $\%$.

  -  Also, the operands in the expressions are all single digit integers. - Declarations

```c
#define MAX_STACK_SIZE 100
#define MAX_EXPR_SIZE 100
typedef enum {lparen, rparen, precedence;
int stack[MAX_STACK_SIZE];
char expr[MAX_EXPR_SIZE];
/* maximum stack size */
/* max size of expression */
plus, minus, times, divide, mod, eos, operand}
/* global stack */
/* input string */
```

#### Program 3.13: Evaluate a postfix expression [ex022]

```c
/*
 * 1) Evaluate a postfix expression, expr, maintained as a global variable.
 * 2) '\0' marks the end of expression.
 * 3) The stack and top of the stack are global variables.
 * 4) getToken is used to return the token type and the character symbol.
 * 5) Operands are assumed to be single character digits.
 * */
int eval(void) {
    precedence token;
    char symbol;
    int op1, op2;
    int n = 0;    /* counter for the expression string */
    token = getToken(&symbol, &n);

    while(token != eos) {
        if(token == operand){
            push(symbol - '0');   /* insert to stack */
        }
        else {
            /* remove two operands, perform operation, 
            and return result to the stack */

            op2 = pop();  /* stack delete */
            op1 = pop();
            switch(token) {
                case plus: push(op1+op2); break;
                case minus: push(op1-op2); break;
                case times: push(op1*op2); break;
                case divide: push(op1/op2); break;
                case mod: push(op1%op2);
            } 
        }token = getToken(&symbol, &n);
    }
    return pop(); /* return result */
}

```

#### Program 3.14: Get a token from the input string

```c
precedence getToken(char *symbol, int *n) {
  *symbol = expr[(*n)++];
  switch(*symbol) {
    case '(': return lparen;
    case ')': return rparen;
    case '+': return plus;
    case '-': return minus;
    case '/': return divide;
    case '*': return times;
    case '%': return mod;
    case '\0': return eos;
    default: return operand;
  } 
}
```

### 3.6.3 Infix To Postfix

- An algorithm for producing a postfix expression from an infix one
  - Step 1: Fully parenthesize the expression
  - Step 2: Move all binary operators so that they replace their corresponding right parenthesis
  - Step 3: Delete all parenthesis



- Example: $a/b–c+d*e–a*c$
  - AfterStep1: $((((a/b)–c)+(d*e))–(a*c))$
  - AfterStep2 and 3: $ab/c–de*+ac*-$



- Although this algorithm works well when done by hand, it is inefficient on a computer because it requires two passes.

- Note that the order of operands is the same in infix and postfix.

- Thus, we can form the postfix equivalent by scanning the infix expression left-to-right.

- However, the order in which the operators are output depends on their precedence.

- Since we must output the higher precendence operators first, we save operators until we know their correct placement.
  - We stack operators as long as the precedence of the operator at the top of the stack is less than the precendence of the incoming operator.

  
  
- Parenthesized expression

  -  Stack "(" and operators until we reach ")".

  -  At this point we unstack until we reach the corresponding "(".

  -  Delete ")".


 - Example: Translation of a+b*c to postfix

<img width="204" alt="image-20211003150755011" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751255-258a08d3-66d1-40b0-b13a-7cf1354789b6.png">

 - Example: Translation of a*(b+c)/d to postfix

<img width="204" alt="image-20211003150806278" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751257-ab10c6eb-ee51-4155-83d9-71c5ebdb9ac4.png">

- The analysis of the two examples suggests a precedence-based scheme for stacking and unstacking operators.
- We need two types of precedence, an in-stack precedence (isp) and an incoming precedence (icp).
  - Remove an operator from the stack only if its isp >= icp of the new operator.

```c
precedence stack[MAX_STACK_SIZE];
/* isp and icp arrays - index is value of precendence for
   lparen, rparen, plus, minus, times, divide, mod, eos */
static int isp[] = {0, 19, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 0};
static int icp[] = {20, 19, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 0};
```

#### Program 3.15: Convert infix to postfix [ex023]

```c
void postfix(void) {
    /*
  1) output the postfix of the expression
  2) the expression string, stack, and the top are global */
    char symbol;
    precedence token;
    int n = 0;
    top = 0; /* global variable */ stack[0] = eos;
    for(token = getToken(&symbol, &n); token != eos; token = getToken(&symbol, &n)) { if(token == operand)
        printf("%c", symbol);
        else if(token == rparen) {
            /* unstack tokens until left parenthesis */ while(stack[top] != lparen)
                printToken(pop());
            pop(); /* discard the left parenthesis */
        }
        else {
            /* remove and print symbols whose isp is greater than or equal to
            the current token's icp */ while(isp[stack[top]] >= icp[token])
                printToken(pop());
            push(token);
        } }
    while((token = pop()) != eos) printToken(token);
    printf("\n");
}
```



#### Analysis of postfix

- Let n be the number of tokens in the expression
- Θ(n) time is spent extracting tokens and outputting them.
- Θ(n) time is spent in two while loops, as the number of tokens that get stacked and unstacked is linear in n.
- Thus, the time complexity of function postfix is Θ(n).
