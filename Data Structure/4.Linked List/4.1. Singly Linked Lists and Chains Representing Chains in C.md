## Singly Linked Lists and Chains Representing Chains in C(Chapter 4.1-2)

### Representation of Lists

- Sequential representation

  - storing successive elements of the data object a fixed distance apart

  

  - adequate for many operations
    - Sequentially inserting elements
    - Reading elements sequentially or arbitrarily
    
    
    
  - difficulty occurs when
    - inserting or deleting an arbitrary element
    - storing several lists of varying sizes in different arrays of maximum size (waste of storage)
    - data movements are frequent
    
    

- Linked representation

  - A node, associated with an element in the list, contains a data component and a pointer to the next item in the list.
  - The pointers are often called links. 3
  
  

### Review: Pointers

- C provides extensive support for pointers

  - The value of a pointer type is a memory address.

  - Operators

    - &: address operator

    - *: the dereferencing (or indirection) operator

- C allows us to perform arithmetic operations and relational operations on pointers. Also, we can convert pointers to integers.

```c
int i;
int *pi;
pi = &i;   
/* the value of pi is the memory address of i */
i = 10;
*pi = 10;  
/* same as assigning 10 to variable i */
```



- The NULL pointer

  - The NULL pointer points to nothing (no object nor function).

  - The NULL pointer is represented by the integer 0.
    - If a pointer type variable has value 0, it is a NULL pointer.

  - NULL is defined to be 0 in <stdio.h>

```c
int *pi = NULL;
*pi = 100;   /* cannot assign a value to a NULL pointer */
```

- Care must be taken when using pointers
  - Since any value can be assigned to the pointer variable, you must fully understand what you are doing with the pointers

  
  
- Good practices when using pointers

  - Set all pointers to NULL when they are not actually pointing to an object.
- Use explicit type cast when converting between pointer types.
  
```c
  int *pi;
  float *pf;
  pi = malloc(sizeof(int));
  pf = (float*) pi;
  ```
  


### Linked Lists: Concept

- list elements are stored, in memory, in an arbitrary order.

- Explicit information (called a link) is used to go from one element to the next.

- Layout of L = (a, b, c, d, e) using an array (sequential) representation

- The linked representation of the list

<img width="358" alt="image-20211003164928055" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752084-ebb7c5a5-d3a3-471d-927a-378b639aaba7.png">

- Each element maintains a pointer (a link) to the next element
- The last element "e" points to NULL.
- There is a pointer variable "first" that points to the first element "a".

- Typically a "node" is a struct type consisting of "data" and a "link".
  - The data could have multiple fields with different types.

### Singly Linked List

- A basic type of linked lists
- Also called chains.

- The last element points to the first element

<img width="358" alt="image-20211003165017954" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752102-331720e7-bbaa-4271-ab7a-08ffaa9fa241.png">



### Doubly Linked List

- Each node points to the next node and the previous node.

<img width="358" alt="image-20211003165044810" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752106-b9b800f2-0258-49ea-acc1-9516a8fbdace.png">

- Each node points to the next node and the previous node.
- The next node of the last node is the first node.
- The previous node of the first node is the last node.

### Linked Lists: Representation

- Representation of a linked list         

```c
struct listNode {
  char data;
  struct listNode *link;
};
struct listNode *first;
```

- Reading the first element (assuming the list has 5 elements)

  ```c
  struct listNode *currNode = first;
  return currNode->data;
  ```

<img width="372" alt="image-20211003165144185" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752108-77f539af-8342-4e3c-92a6-e2823e584cda.png">



### Linked Lists: Reading an Element [ex024]

- Reading the second element

  ```c
  currNode = first->link;  /* move to the second node */ 
  return currNode->data;
  ```

- Reading the third element

  ```c
  currNode = first->link->link;   /* move to the third node */ 
  return currNode->data;
  ```

- Reading the sixth element (?)

  ```c
  currNode = first->link->link->link->link->link; 
  return currNode->data;
  ```

  

### Linked Lists: Deleting an Element

- Deleting the first element
  - Since "first" is pointing to the first element, we need to change its value.

```c
struct ListNode *delNode = first;
first = first->link;  /* move the "first" pointer*/
free(delNode);
```

<img width="372" alt="image-20211003165348192" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752109-d68cea3b-4817-4257-9c2b-eb2fed31424b.png">

- Deleting an element from the middle of the list 
  - The previous node should now point to the next node.

- Suppose we are trying to remove "c" from the list. 

- First, we need to get to the node just before "c".

  ```c
  struct listNode *beforeNode, *delNode;
  beforeNode = first->link;
  ```

<img width="372" alt="image-20211003165412502" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752110-c3e8b3fe-a366-4b60-b000-69ed8b5203f3.png">

- We save the pointer to the node that will be deleted.

  ```c
  delnode = beforeNode->link;
  ```

- Then, change the link of "beforeNode". It should point to the node next to the deleted node.

  ```c
  beforeNode->link = beforeNode->link->link;
  ```

- Finally, delete the node.

  ```c
  free(deleteNode);
  ```

<img width="372" alt="image-20211003165501150" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752111-67fe22f0-1bfe-4abc-ac32-851c431ee265.png">

### Linked Lists: Inserting an Element

- Inserting an element at the front of the list
  - Suppose we want to insert a new node with data "f" at the front of the list.

- First, we need to create the new node.

```c
struct listNode *newNode;
newNode = malloc(sizeof(*newNode));
newNode->data = 'f';
newNode->link = NULL;  /* initially we make the pointer NULL */
```

<img width="372" alt="image-20211003165529137" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752112-ec17f351-db51-42b1-bdaf-458f704dc9eb.png">

- If the new node is to be inserted at the front of the list, the link of the new node should point to the first node in the list. 

  ```c
  newNode->link = first;
  ```

- Since the first node of the list is changed, we must update "first".

  ```c
  first=newNode;
  ```

  <img width="380" alt="image-20211003165558182" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752131-81bef148-f9e5-4173-9a6e-47a0c17a7c83.png">

- Inserting an element in the middle of the list
  - Suppose we want to insert element "f" as element whose index is 3. (4th element)

- First, we create the new node. 

- Next, we move to the node whose index is 2.

  ```c
  beforeNode = first->link->link;
  ```

  <img width="380" alt="image-20211003165625393" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752133-81df6ff3-f40b-409d-ac67-87c8d9aaaa82.png">



- Then, we let the previous node point to the new node, and let the new node point to the next node.

  - Be careful about the order of statements.

  ```c
  newNode->link = beforeNode->link;
  
  beforeNode->link = newNode;
  ```

### Example: A Linked List of Integers [ex025]

- We would like to write a program where we manage a linked list of integers.

- We want to maintain the list so that the integers are sorted in the ascending order.
  - A small integer comes before a larger integer

  
  
- Also, we are not going to allow two instances of the same integer twice.
  - All integers in the list must be unique.

  
  
- We need to implement the following operations

  - Insert an integer to the list

  - Delete an integer from the list

  - Check whether an integer exists in the list
    - returns the index if the integer exists, returns -1 if not.

    
    
  - Count how many integers are in the list
  
  - Print the integers in the ascending order

<img width="233" alt="image-20211003165711731" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752136-4f1092d2-944a-44eb-8e2c-502535870696.png">

- Representation of the list 
  - We will use a singly linked list.

  
  
- global variables

```c
struct listNode {
  int data;
  struct listNode *link;
};
struct listNode *head; // points to the first element of the list
```

- Finding an integer in the list

```c
int find(int key) {
  struct listNode* curr = head;
  int i = 0;
  while(curr) {
    if(curr->data == key) return i;
    i++;
    curr = curr->link;
}
return -1; }
```

- Counting the number of integers in the list

```c
int length() {
  struct listNode* curr = head;
  int i = 0;
  while(curr) {
i++;
    curr = curr->link;
  }
return i; }
```

- Printing the integers in the ascending order

```c
void printList() {
  struct listNode* curr = head;
  int i = 0;
  while(curr) {
    printf("%d ", curr->data);
    curr = curr->link;
  }
  printf("\n");
}
```
