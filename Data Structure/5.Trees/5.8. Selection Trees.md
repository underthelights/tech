## Selection Trees(Chapter 5.8)

### 5.8.1 Introduction

- A selection tree is a tree where the key of a parent node is equal to one of the keys of its child nodes.
- A typical application of a selection tree is sorting.
- There are two kinds of selection trees : winner trees and loser trees.

### 5.8.2 Winner Trees

- A winner tree is a complete binary tree with n external nodes and n - 1 internal nodes.

- External nodes represent tournament players.

- Each internal node represents a match played between its two children; the winner of the match is stored at the internal node.

- The root node has the overall winner.

- Suppose we have a list of 16 numbers that are not sorted.

  - In a tournament game, the smaller number wins the match.

- How many games do we need to play in order to decide the overall winner ?

- We need to play 15 games.

- Initializing the winner tree takes O(n), when n is the number of players entering the tournament.
- After initializing the winner tree, we remove the key at the root.

- Then, we remove the player that eventually won the tournament.
  - The internal nodes should remember the player(array index or pointer to the node) as well as its key.
  - We can replace the key of the winner with a large number.

- After removing the winner, we do a rematch along the branches from the previous winner to the root.

  - Other matches do not need to be redone.

- Similarly, remove the winnerand do a rematch.

- We continue this until all players are removed(changed to 99).

  - We have sorted the numbers.

#### Analysis of Winner Tree

- Initializing takes O(n) time.
- Removing the winner and replaying takes O(log n) time.
  - Move along the branches from the removed node to the root.
- We need to repeat "removing the winner and replaying" n times.
  - This will take O(n log n) time.
- Total sort time is O(n log n).



### 5.8.3 Loser Trees

- In a loser tree, each internal node stores the loser of the match.
  - Don't get confused: we are still looking for the overall winner.
- Suppose we have moved the winner with key = 1, and replaced the node with key = 99.
- Then, we need to do replays along the branches from the replaced node to the root.
- In a winner tree, in order to do replay, we needed to compare the keys between the replaced nodeand its sibling.

- However, in a loser tree, you do not need to compare keys with the sibling.
- Instead, you can directly move to the parentand update the winner since the parent remembers the previous loser.
- A loser tree avoids accessing siblings during replays, which makes it slightly more efficient than winner trees.
