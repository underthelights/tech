## Binary Search Trees(Chapter 5.7)

### 5.7.1 Definition

- A binary search tree is a binary tree that has the following properties.

  - Each node has exactly one key and the keys in the tree are distinct.

  - The keys(if any) in the left subtree are smaller than the key in the root.

  - The keys(if any) in the right subtree are larger than the key in the root.

  - The leftand the right subtrees are also binary search tree.

- A binary search tree can be empty. (no elements)

### 5.7.2 Searching a Binary Search Tree

- As its name suggests, one of the main use of a binary search tree is to efficiently search arbitrary elements in the tree.

- Suppose we would like to search for an element with key k.
  - First, we compare k with the key in the root.
  - If the key in the root is k, then we are done.

  - If k is less than root's key, we search the left subtree of the root.

  - If k is larger than root's key, we search the right subtree of the root.

- A recursive version of function search.

```c
element* search(treePointer root, int k) {
  /* return a pointer to the element whose key is k, if there is no such element, return NULL */
  if(!root) return NULL;
  if(k == root->data.key) 
    return &(root->data);
  if(k < root->data.key) 
    return search(root->leftChild, k);
  return search(root->rightChild, k);
}
```

- Suppose we want to search for an element with key 15.

  <img width="275" alt="image-20211002201346983" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135757886-be47c3e6-ddde-495a-bd76-3253377ff887.png">

- We start by comparing k(= 15) with the root's key.

- Because 15 is smaller than 20, we search for k in its left subtree.

  <img width="275" alt="image-20211002201358585" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135757887-f42a3937-d76f-4d42-9812-6dc99c12d15d.png">

- Since 15 is larger than 10. We move to the right subtree.

- Now we compare k with the root of the subtree.

- This time, the key matches with k, and we have found the element.

- An iterative version of function search

  ```c
  element* iterSearch(treePointer tree, int k) {
    /* return a pointer to the element whose key is k, if there is no such element, return NULL */
    while(tree) {
      if(k == tree->data.key) 
        return &(tree->data);
      if(k < tree->data.key)
        tree = tree->leftChild;
      else
        tree = tree->rightChild;
    }
    return NULL;
  }
  ```

  

- Time complexity of searchand iterSearch: **O(h)**
  - h is the height of the tree.

  - Can we use n(number of nodes) instead of h to indicate the time complexity ?



### 5.7.3 Inserting into a Binary Search Tree

- Suppose we want to insert an element with key k to the binary search tree.

- First, we search for an element with key k in the tree.

- If the element exists, then we cancel the insertion.

  - Duplicate keys are not allowed in a binary search tree.

- If the element does not exist, then we add the new element at the position where the search was terminated.

  - This will maintain the characteristics of a binary search tree.

- Suppose we want to insert an element with k = 12 to the binary subtree.

  <img width="235" alt="image-20211002201547844" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135757892-56cfe3e5-28d0-4c4d-8426-7308b5416ae6.png">

- First, we search for the element.
  - We start from the root of the tree.

    <img width="235" alt="image-20211002201608190" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135757956-97b6607a-c582-4fc8-9500-e24da615afc7.png">

- Because 12 is smaller than 20, we move to the left subtree.

- Then, since 12 is larger than 10, we move to the right subtree.

  <img width="458" alt="image-20211002201621329" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135757959-aa04aeae-785d-4639-bff2-10676319a6df.png">

- Since 12 is less than 15, we move to the left subtree.

- We find out that the left subtree is an empty tree.

- Then, at the position, we insert the new element.

- Function insertNode

```c
void insertNode(treePointer *node, int k) {
  /* if the key k is already in the tree, do nothing; otherwise add a new
     node with key k */
  treePointer ptr, temp = modifiedSearch(*node, k);
  if(temp || !(*node)) {
    /* k is not in the tree */
    ptr = (treePointer)malloc(sizeof(*ptr));
    ptr->data.key = k;
    ptr->leftChild = ptr->rightChild = NULL;
    if(*node) {
      if(k < temp->data.key) temp->leftChild = ptr;
      else temp->rightChild = ptr;
    }
    else *node = ptr;
  }
}
```



- Function modifiedSearch searches the binary tree* node for the key k.
  - If the tree is empty or if k is present, the function returns NULL.	
  - Otherwise, the function returns a pointer to the last node of the tree that was encountered during the search.

- Analysis of function insertNode

  - Let h be the height of the binary search tree.

  - The search requires O(h) timeand the remainder of the algorithm takes O(1) time.

  - Thus, the overall time needed by insertNode is O(h).



### 5.7.4 Deletion from a Binary Search Tree

- When deleting an arbitrary node from a binary search tree, we must take care to restore the characteristics of the binary search tree after deletion.
  - Four cases
- Case 1: If the node does not exist, we are done.

- Case 2 : If the node is a leaf node
  - This is the easiest case.Just set the corresponding child field of its parent to NULLand free the node.

    <img width="407" alt="image-20211002201736133" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135757965-ad2fea2c-1d0c-4b5d-8ff2-17dca683acd2.png">

- Case 3: If the deleted node is a nonleaf node with a single child
  - We place the single child in the place of the deleted node.

  <img width="453" alt="image-20211002201751378" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135757967-2c7da5a9-a0e9-4338-ac63-aba8f7803d7e.png">

- Case 4 : If the deleted node is a nonleaf node with two children

  - This is the most difficult case.
  - We should replace the deleted node with either the largest element in its left subtree or the smallest element in its right subtree.

  - Then, delete this replacing element from the subtree from which it was taken.

- Suppose we want to remove the element with key = 60 from the BST.
  - <img width="221" alt="image-20211002201811465" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135758002-ac540a17-51f9-4cc9-ac01-b59cd7e6d4c7.png">

- First we choose the replacing element.We will choose the largest element in the left subtree.

- We replace the node with key = 55 at the position of the deleted node.

- Then, we remove the node from the left subtree.
  - When removing the node from the left subtree, it must be a leaf node, or a nonleaf node with a single child.

  - The the replacing node has a single child, the child will now take place of the replacing node in the left subtree.

#### [ex039]

- Implement function deleteNode
  - Follow the descriptions in the previous slides.
  - The time complexity of deleteNode should be O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

```c
void deleteNode(treePointer *node, int k) {
  /* implement the function */
}
```



### 5.7.6 Height of a Binary Search Tree

- Until now, we have indicated time complexity of operations search, insert, and delete as O(h), where h is the height of the binary search tree.

- What is the height of a binary search tree, with respect to number of elements n ?

- Suppose starting from an empty tree, let us try to insert the elements with keys in the following order : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

- What would be the height of the binary search tree after inserting the 10 elements ?

- Unless care is taken, the height of a binary tree with n elements can become as large as n.

- If insertionsand deletions are made at random, the expected height of the binary search tree is O(log2n) on the average.

- Search trees with a worst - case height of O(log2n) are called balanced search trees.
  - e.g.) AVL trees, red / black trees, 2 - 3 trees, 2 - 3 - 4 trees, B trees, B + trees, etc.
