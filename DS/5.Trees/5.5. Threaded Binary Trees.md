## Threaded Binary Trees (Chapter 5.5)

- A binary tree T with n nodes has 2n links

  - each node has 2 links

  - Among them, (n+1) are NULL links

  - why?

- NULL links are wasted memory space

- Utilizing the space that were originally NULL
  - Replace the NULL links by pointers, called threads, to other nodes in the tree by using the following rules

- Keep the leftmost and the rightmost NULL pointers as NULL

- Change all other NULL pointers as

  - Left pointer = inorder predecessor

  - Right pointer = inorder successor



### Inorder traversal

- Keep the leftmost and the rightmost NULL pointers as NULL.

- Change all other NULL pointers as
  - Left pointer = inorder predecessor

  - Right pointer = inorder successor

  - H D I B E A F C G J

- When we use threads, we must be able to distinguish between threads and normal pointers
  - Is "right_child" pointing to the actual right child or is it pointing to the next node in inorder traversal?

- For this reason, we add two additional fields to the node.
  - Flags indicating whether the pointer is a thread or not.

```c
struct threaded_tree {
  short int left_thread;
  struct threaded_tree *left_child;
  char data;
  struct threaded_tree *right_child;
  short int right_thread;
};
```



- Until now, we have replaced all NULL links to point to something.

- Two links are still NULL links: the leftmost and the rightmost link.

- In order to utilize these two links, we create a dummy node and use that as the root of the tree.

- The original root node now is the left child of the dummy root.

- Then, the leftmost and the rightmost link point to the dummy root node.

### Finding the inorder successor of a node

- Using the threads, we can perform an inorder traversal without making use of a stack.

- If ptr->right_thread = TRUE, the inorder successor of ptr is ptr->right_child.

- Else, we obtain the next node by following a path of left-child links from ptr->right_child until we reach a node with left_thread = TRUE.

- Inorder successor of node I?
  - Node I's right_thread is TRUE. So node I's inorder successor is node B.

- Inorder successor of node B?
  - Node B's right_thread if FALSE.

  - The node that follows right_child of node B is node E. Node E's left_thread is TRUE. 
  - So, node E is the inorder successor of node B.

- Inorder successor of node A?
  - Node A's right_thread is FALSE.

  - The node that follows right_child of node A is node C.
    Node C's left_thread is FALSE.
    The left_child of node C is node F.
    Node F's left_thread is TRUE.
  - So, node F is the inorder successor of node A.

```c
threaded_pointer insucc(threaded_pointer tree) {
  /* find the inorder successor of a tree in a threaded binary tree */
  threaded_pointer temp;
  temp = tree->right_child;
  if(!tree->right_thread)
    while(!temp->left_thread)
      temp = temp->left_child;
  return temp;
}
```



- To perform an inorder traversal, we make repeated calls to insucc.

```c
void tinorder(threaded_pointer tree) {
  /* traverse the threaded binary tree inorder */
  threaded_pointer temp = tree;
  for( ; ; ) {
    temp = insucc(temp);
    if(temp == tree) break;
    printf("%3c", temp->data);
} }
```



### Inserting a node into a threaded binary tree

- Assume that we have a node, parent, that has an empty right subtree.

- We wish to insert child as the right child of parent.

  <img width="250" alt="image-20211002224748668" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135757648-bce5dea6-5fc3-4f4c-8b0c-a93e69f47065.png">



- To do this, we must:
  - change parent->right_thread to FALSE.
  - set child->left_thread and child->right_thread to TRUE.
  - set child->left_child to point to parent.

  - set child->right_child to point to parent->right_child.

  - change parent->right_child to point to child.

- Assume that we have a node, parent, that has an nonempty right subtree.

- We wish to insert child as the right child of parent.

- In this case, the child becomes the inorder predecessor of a node that has a left_thread == TRUE, and thus the thread of that node needs to be updated.

  - This node was previously the inorder successor of parent.

- The code that handles both cases

```c
void insert_right(threaded_pointer parent, threaded_pointer child) {
  /* insert child as the right child of parent in a threaded binary tree */
  threaded_pointer temp;
  child->right_child = parent->right_child;
  child->right_thread = parent->right_thread;
  child->left_child = parent;
  child->left_thread = TRUE;
  parent->right_child = child;
  parent->right_thread = FALSE;
  if(!child->right_thread) {
    temp = insucc(child);
    temp->left_child = child;
  }
}
```
