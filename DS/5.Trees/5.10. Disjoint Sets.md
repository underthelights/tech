## Disjoint Sets (Chapter 5.10)

### 5.10.1 Representation of Disjoint Sets

- We can use trees to represent sets.
  - For simplicity, here we will assume that the elements of the sets are numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1.

  - We also assume that the sets being represented are pairwise disjoint.

    - An element can be included in only one of the sets.
    - Thus we call these sets "**disjoint sets**".
    
    
  
- Representation of sets S1, S2, and S3 using trees 

  - Instead of maintaining links to child nodes, here we maintain links to the parent.

  - $S1 = \{0, 6, 7, 8\}, S2 =\{1, 4, 9\}, S3 = \{2, 3, 5\}$

- Mapping set names to trees

  - We can have a separate array with elements that contain the set name and the pointer to the root of the tree.

#### Array representation

- Since each node in the trees has a single link to its parent, we can use the parent array to represent the whole disjoint sets.
- The index of array indicates the element (0, ..., n-1) of the tree.

- Parent of root nodes is -1.

- In the array representation, instead of using S1, S2, and S3 as set names, we can let the **root elements represent each set**.



### 5.10.2 Union and Find Operations

#### Operations performed on disjoint sets

- Disjoint set union
  - If we wish to get the union of two disjoint sets Si and Sj, replace Si and Sj by ùëÜ ‚à™ ùëÜ

- Find(i)
  - Find the set containing the element i.

#### Implementing **Union** operation

- We make one of the trees a subtree of the other.
- Set the parent field of one of the roots to the other root.
- <img width="265" alt="image-20211002194835366" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752492-4aca29f8-2b52-4ee5-b0eb-e4d714a410a4.png">



#### Implementing **Find** operation

- We can implement the find operation by simply following the indices starting at i and continuing until we reach a parent index that is a negative number.

- Simple implementation of Find and Union.

- ```c++
  int simpleFind(int i) {
      for( ; parent[i] >= 0; i = parent[i] );
      return i;
  ```

  

- The argument to simpleUnion must be root of the trees 

- ```c++
  int simpleUnion(int i, int j) { 
      parent[i] = j; 
  }
  ```

  

#### Analysis of simpleUnion and simpleFind

- Consider executing the following sequence of union-find operations
  - union(0, 1), find(0) / union(1, 2), find(0) / union(2, 3), find(0) / union(3, 4), find(0) .. / union(n-2, n-1), find(0)
- This sequence of operations produces the following tree.
- Since time taken for a union operation is constant, all n-1 unions can be processed in O(n) time.
- For each find, if the element is at level i, then the time required to find its root is O(i). Hence the total time needed to process
- the n-1 finds is  :$\Sigma_{i=1}^{n-1}{i} = O(n^2)$

<img width="50" alt="image-20211002195104486" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752534-260bc8e2-acc5-4072-9778-d5ba0c7224ed.png">

- We can improve efficiency of the find operation by creating trees that are balanced. To achieve that, we use the weighting rule.

- Weighting rule for union of i and j.
  - If the number of nodes in tree i is less than the number of nodes in tree j, then make j the parent of i; otherwise make i the parent of j.

- When we use this rule on the sequence of set unions described above, we obtain the following trees.

  <img width="288" alt="image-20211002195137200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752536-16d21592-2e71-4907-9df9-c259b983efb9.png">

- To implement the weighting rule, we need to know how many nodes there are in each tree.
  - We need to maintain a count field in the root of every tree.
  - We can maintain the count in the parent field of the roots as a negative number. 

- The argument to the weightedUnion must be root of the trees

```c++
void weightedUnion(int i, int j) {
    int temp = parent[i] + parent[j];
    if(parent[i] > parent[j]) {
        parent[i] = j;/* make j the new root */
        parent[j] = temp;
    }
    else {
        parent[j] = i;/* make i the new root */
        parent[i] = temp;
    } 
}
    
    
```

- Lemma: Let T be a tree with n nodes created as a result of weightedUnion. No node in T has level greater than 

- Proof
  - The lemma is clearly true for n = 1.
  - Assume that it is true for all trees with i nodes, i ‚â§ n-1. We show that it is also true for i = n.
  - Let T be a tree with n nodes created by weightedUnion.

  - Consider the last union operation performed, union(k, j). 

  - Let m be the number of nodes in tree j. Then, n-m is the number of nodes in k.

  - Without loss of generality, we may assume that .

  - Then, the maximum level of any node in T is either the same as k or is one more than j. 

  - If the former is the case, then the maximum level in 
  - If the latter is the case, then the maximum level in T ‚â§ log‡¨∂ ùëö + 2 ‚â§ log‡¨∂ ùëõ/2 + 2 ‚â§ log‡¨∂ ùëõ + 1

- Consider the behavior of weightedUnion on the following sequence of unions starting from the initial configuration
  - union(0, 1), union(2, 3), union(4, 5), union(6, 7), union(0, 2), union(4, 6), union(0, 4)
  - <img width="431" alt="image-20211002195237841" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752538-c31410d0-8c09-4da0-b91d-7d4c96e31b76.png">



#### Analysis of simpleFind and weightedUnion

- The depth of the tree is $\lfloor{log_2 n\rfloor +1}$ when the number of nodes is n.
- The time to process simpleFind in a tree of n nodes is $O(log_2 n)$.
- If we process an intermixed sequence of n-1 union and m find operations, the time becomes $O(n+mlog_2n)$



#### A further improvement: collapsingFind

- We know that in a find operation, we need to move from an arbitrary node in the tree all the way to the root.
- It would be beneficial if we make the number of links from each node to its root as small as possible.
- When we execute collapsingFind(i) operation, we make all nodes in the path from node i to the root directly point to its root. 
  - Afterwards, find operation for these nodes will require only a single move to its root.

```c++
int collapsingFind(int i) {
    int root, trail, lead;
    for(root = i; parent[root] >= 0; root = parent[root]);
    for(trail = i; trail != root; trail = lead) {
        lead = parent[trail];
        parent[trail] = root;
    }
    return root;
}
```



### 5.10.3 Equivalence Classes

- In Chapter 4.6 (Lecture 13), we considered finding the equivalence classes using a linked list.
  - There are 12 items numbered from 0 to 11, and we have the following equivalence pairs.
    - (0, 4), (3, 1), (6, 10), (8, 9), (7, 4), (6, 8), (3, 5), (2, 11), (11, 0)
    - <img width="378" alt="image-20211002195527305" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752540-f709ba60-0666-496d-b677-5ea312f28767.png">

- We can use disjoint set trees to solve the problem of equivalence classes.

- Initially, all n items are in an equivalance class of their own.
  - <img width="384" alt="image-20211002195637302" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135752560-81b0065f-5632-4233-91ad-806995ffd70f.png">

- When processing an equivalence pair (i, j), we first determine the sets containing i and j.

  - If the two sets are the same, then nothing is to be done.

  - If not, we must union the two disjoint set trees.

  - Thus, for each equivalence pair, we need 2 find and 1 union operations.



- Disjoint set trees as the equivalence pairs are processed

#### [ex040]

- Implement a program that takes number of items and equivalence pairs from user input and outputs equivalence classes.
- Your program should use disjoint set trees.
  - Implement find and union operations as well as the main function.
- Refer to [ex034] on how to get user inputs. Following is an example stub.

```c
void main() {
    /* write code here if necessary */
    int i, j, n;
    printf("Enter the size (<= %d) ", MAX_SIZE); scanf("%d", &n);
    /* write code here if necessary */
    printf("Enter a pair of numbers (-1 -1 to quit): "); scanf("%d%d", &i, &j);
    while(i >= 0) {
        /* write code here if necessary */
        printf("Enter a pair of numbers (-1 -1 to quit): "); scanf("%d%d", &i, &j);
        /* write code here if necessary */
    } 
}
```
