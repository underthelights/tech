## Dynamically Allocated Arrays (Chapter 2.2)

### 2.2.1 One-dimensional arrays

- Suppose the size of array is not determined at the time of programming.
- This is how we would typically write the program.

```c
#define MAX_SIZE 100
void main() {
int i, n, data[MAX_SIZE];
printf("How many integers do you want to generate? "); scanf("%d", &n);
for(i=0; i<n; i++) {
        data[i] = rand();
printf("%d\n", data[i]); }
}
```

- This program has the following drawbacks
  - If the number of integers is smaller than 100, we are wasting memory.
  - If the number of integers is larger than 100, then the program will stop abruptly (bad), or behave unexpectedly (worse).



- A good solution to this problem is to defer memory allocation to run time, when we have a good estimate of the required array size.

  ```c
  void main() {
    int i, n, *data;
    printf("How many integers do you want to generate? "); 
    scanf("%d", &n);
    data = malloc(n*sizeof(int));
  
    for(i=0; i<n; i++) {
      data[i] = rand();
      printf("%d\n", data[i]); 
    }
    free(data);
  }
  ```

  - void* malloc(size_t size)
     - allocates a block of size bytes of memory, returning a pointer to the beginning of the block.

     
     
  - When you are done using the memory space, you should return the allocated memory using free.

### One-dimensional arrays [ex004]
 - If you need to change the size of array after allocation, you can use the function realloc to do so.

```c
void main() {
    int i, n, m, *data;
    printf("How many integers do you want to generate? ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    data = malloc(n*sizeof(int));
    for(i=0; i<n; i++) 
        data[i] = rand();
    printf("How many integers do you want to generate additionally? "); 
    scanf("%d", &m);
    data = realloc(data, (n+m)*sizeof(int));
    for(i; i<n+m; i++) 
        data[i] = rand();
    for(i=0; i<n+m; i++) 
        printf("%3d: %8d\n", i+1, data[i]); 
    free(data);
}
```



- If additional memory can be allocated without changing the address, it is done so.
- If it is not possible, then memory is allocated at some other place, and the data is copied from the original memory space to the new memory space.

### 2.2.2 Two-dimensional arrays
 - A 2D array is represented as a 1D array in which each element is a 1D array.

   ```c
   int x[3][5];
   ```

 - A 3D array is represented as a 1D array in which each element is a 2D array.

### Program 2.3 [ex005]

```c
int **make2dArray(int rows, int cols) {
    int **x, i;
    /* allocate memory for row pointers */ 
    x = malloc(rows * sizeof(*x));
    /* allocate memory for each row */ 
    for (i = 0; i < rows; i++)
        x[i] = malloc(cols * sizeof(**x));
    return x;
}
```

- You can use calloc instead of malloc.
- void* calloc(size_t num, size_t size)
  - allocates a block of memory for an array of num elements, each of them size bytes long, and initializes all its bits to zero.

- You should also free the allocated memory after use.
