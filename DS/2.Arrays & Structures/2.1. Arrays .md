## Arrays (Chapter 2.1)

### 2.1.1 Arrays as an abstract data type

- A set of pairs <index, value>, such that each index has a value associated with it.
  - $<0, 99>, <1, 88>, <2, 77>, <3, 66>, <4, 55>$
  - $<0, 'a'>, <1, 'b'>, <2, 'c'>, <3, 'd'>, <4, 'e'>$
  
  
- Many operations can be applied to arrays, but standard operations are:
  - create an array
  - store a value in the array
  - retrieve a value from the array

#### An example specification of ADT Array

```c
ADT Array is
  
  objects : 
	A set of pairs <index, value> where for each value of index there is a value from the set item. Index is a finite set of one or more dimensions, for example, {0, . . ., n-1} for one dimension, {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)} for two dimensions, etc.


	functions :
	for all A ∈ Array, i ∈ index, x ∈ item, j, size ∈ integer


Array Create(j, list) 
	::= return an array of j dimensions where list is a j-tuple whose ith element is the size of the ith dimension. Items are undefined.
  
Item Retrieve(A, i) 
	::= if (i ∈ index) 
    return the item associated with index value i in array A
	else 
    return error.

Array Store(A, i, x)
	::= if (i ∈ index) 
    return an array that is identical to array A except the new pair <i, x> has been inserted 
	else 
    return error.
    
end Array
```



### 2.1.2 Arrays in C

- Arrays are supported as a composite data type in C

- Declaration of one-dimensional arrays in C

  ```c
  int list[5];
  ```

  - This line reserves memory space for five integers. • Memory allocation of arrays

| Variable | Memory Address      |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| list[0]  | base address = a    |
| list[1]  | a + sizeof(int)     |
| list[2]  | a + 2 * sizeof(int) |
| list[3]  | a + 3 * sizeof(int) |
| list[4]  | a + 4 * sizeof(int) |

- When you declare an integer array as follows, list2 is interpreted as a pointer to an integer.

  ```c
  int list2[5];
  ```

- In other words, list2 is the same type as list1 which is declared as a pointer to an integer.

  ```c
  int *list1;
  ```

  

- The difference is that for list2, memory space for 5 integers are reserved.

- To use list1 as an integer array, memory should be allocated dynamically.



- We can use list2 as a pointer

  ```
       int list2[5];
  ```

  - list2: a pointer to list2[0]
  - list2 + i: a pointer to list2[i]
  - (list2+i) is equal to &list2[i]
  - *(list2+i) is equal to list2[i]

### Program 2.1 [ex002]

```c
#define MAX_SIZE 100
float sum(float[], int);
float input[MAX_SIZE], answer; int i;
void main() {
    for(i=0; i<MAX_SIZE; i++)
input[i] = i;
answer = sum(input, MAX_SIZE); printf("The sum is: %f\n", answer);
}
float sum(float list[], int n) { int i;
    float tempsum = 0;
    for(i=0; i<n; i++)
        tempsum += list[i];
    return tempsum;
}
```

- When function sum is called, input (pointer to input[0]) is copied into a temporary location and is associated with the formal parameter list. 

  ```c
  answer = sum(input, MAX_SIZE);
  ```

- When list[i] occurs on the right-hand side of '=' in an assignment statement, a dereferencing takes place and the value pointed at by (list+i) is returned.

  ```
  tempsum += list[i];
  ```

- If list[i] appears on the left-hand side of '=', then the value produced on the right-hand side is stored in the location (list+i).

### Program 2.2 [ex003]

- print1 is a function that prints out both the address of the ith element and the value found at this address.

```c
void print1(int*, int);
void main() {
    int one[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    print1(one, 5);
}
void print1(int *ptr, int rows) {
  /* print out a one-dimensional array using a pointer */
  int i;
  printf("address contents\n");
  for(i = 0; i < rows; i++)
    printf("%8p%5d\n", ptr+i, *(ptr+i));
  printf("\n");
}
```
