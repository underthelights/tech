## Minimum Cost Spanning Trees (Chapter 6.3)

- Here we consider a weighted undirected graph that is connected. 
  - Edges have weights (costs).
- The cost of a spanning tree is the sum of the costs of the edges in the spanning tree.
- A minimum (cost) spanning tree is a spanning tree of that has the least cost.

- Spanning trees of graph G and their costs
  - Because there are 4 vertices in the graph, its spanning tree has exactly 3 edges.
  - We choose 3 edges out of 5 edges, so total number of combinations is 10.
  - Among them, 2 combinations lead to cycles.
  - Thus we have a total of 8 different spanning trees.

- Algorithms for finding the minimum cost spanning tree of a graph
  - Kruskal's algorithm
  - Prim's algorithm
  - Sollin's algorithm
  
- All three algorithms are greedy algorithms.
  - At each stage, we make a decision that is the best decision at that time.
  - Since we cannot change this decision later, we make sure that the decision will result in a feasible solution.
  
- To find a minimum spanning tree using a greedy algorithm
  - At each stage, we select a least cost edge based on some constraints.

### 6.3.1 Kruskal's Algorithm

- Kruskal's algorithm builds a minimum cost spanning tree T by adding edges to T one at a time.
- The algorithm selects the edges for inclusion in T in nondecreasing order of their cost.
- An edge is added to T if it does not form a cycle with edges that are already in T.
- If G is connected and has vertices n > 0, exactly n-1 edges will be selected for inclusion in T.

#### Pseudocode for Kruskal's algorithm

```pseudocode
T = {};
while(T contains less than n-1 edges && E is not empty) {
   choose a least cost edge (v, w) from E;
   delete (v, w) from E;
   if((v, w) does not create a cycle in T)
        add(v, w) to T;
   else
        discard(v, w);
}

if(T contains fewer than n-1 edges)
	printf("no spanning tree\n");
```

- Example
  - We would like to find a minimum cost spanning tree of the following graph.
  - We will denote this graph as G = (V, E)
  - The set of edges in the spanning tree is called T.

- We start from an empty set of edges. 

   - T={}

- We select an edge from E that
  - isnotinT.
  - does not create a cycle with edges in T.
  - has the minimum cost.
  - T becomes {(0,5)}

- We repeat this process 
  - T={(0,5)}
  - T={(0,5),(2,3)}
  - T={(0,5),(2,3),(1,6)}
  - T={(0,5),(2,3),(1,6),(1,2)}

- The next minimum cost edge is (3, 6), but adding this edge to T will create a cycle. Thus, this edge is not selected.

- We continue selecting least cost edges that does not create a cycle in T. – We stop when we have n-1 edges in T.

#### Implementing Kruskal's algorithm

- In order to implement the algorithm, we need two things:
  1. Selecting an edge in E and not in T that has the minimum cost

  2. Checking whether adding an edge in T will create a cycle

- Selecting an edge in E and not in T that has the minimum cost
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762003-1f2d20f3-0d63-405e-9951-71f03f8aa1ba.png)
  
  - We can use a data structure where edges are sorted in the ascending order of their costs (weights).
  - At each stage, we can delete the edge from the data structure.
  - We can use a min heap for this purpose.
  
- Checking whether adding an edge in T will create a cycle
  - Suppose the edge we select next is (u, w).
  - Then, we should find out whether u and w is already connected in T.
  - We can use disjoint sets and union-find operations for this purpose.

#### 1. Selecting an edge in E and not in T that has the minimum cost

- Edges sorted in the ascending order of cost in a min heap

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762055-407a9e8c-3dd6-4805-9011-9e3218d0afbf.png)

 - The position of nodes in the heap could vary based on how the heap is created.

#### 2. Checking whether adding an edge in T will create a cycle

- Disjoint Sets
   - Initially, all vertices are in different sets.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762056-d48de037-526c-4393-b9d5-610ede30dde1.png)

- Once an edge (u, v) is inserted to T, the disjoint set trees containing u and v are combined using the union operation.
  - vertices in the same disjoint set tree are connected.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762084-0cd88f21-3efc-4d9a-8f31-4fc110c8e145.png)
  
- We skip a few steps until we come to this point.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762090-4b1bf867-40b3-4906-bb6b-5e115539c779.png)

- The next least cost edge is (3, 6), but Find(3) and Find(6) will result in the same number.
  - This means that vertices 3 and 6 are already connected in T.
  - If we add (3, 6) to T, it will create a cycle.
  - Thus, (3, 6) is discarded → this is how we avoid cycles.

[ex044]

- Time complexity when implemented using min heap and disjoint sets
 - Suppose n is the number of vertices and e is the number of edges in the graph.

- Creating the min heap
  - We insert edges into the min heap.
  - Each insertion requires O(log e) time.
  - We need to insert e edges.
  - Thus, the time complexity for creating min heap is O(e log e).
- Manipulating disjoint set trees
  - For each stage, we delete an edge from min heap and check whether the end points are connected.
    - To find out if they are connected, we need to run two find operations → O(log n)
    - To combine two disjoint trees, we need to run a single union operation → O(1)
  - The time complexity for manipulating disjoint set trees is O(e log n).
- The total time complexity is O(e log e) or O(e log n).
  - Sincee=O(n2),loge=O(2logn)=O(logn)
  - Thus, O(e log e) is equivalent to O(e log n)

### 6.3.2 Prim's Algorithm

- Prim's algorithm constructs the minimum cost spanning tree by adding one edge at a time.
  - At each stage, the set of selected edges forms a tree.

- The algorithm begins with a tree, T, that contains a single vertex. – The starting vertex may be arbitrary.

- Next,weaddaleastcostedge(u,v)toTsuchthatTՍ{(u,v)}isalsoatree.
- We repeat this edge addition step until T contains n-1 edges.
- To make sure that the added edge does not form a cycle, at each step we choose the edge (u, v) such that exactly one of u or v is in T.



 - Pseudocode for Prim's algorithm

```pseudocode
T = {};      
/* set of edges in the spanning tree */
TV = {0};    
/* set of vertices in the spanning tree */
while(T contains fewer than n-1 edges) {
let (u,v) be a least cost edge such that u ∈ TV and v ∉ TV;
  if (there is no such edge)
    break;
add v to TV;
  add (u,v) to T;
}
if (T contains fewer than n-1 edges)
  printf("no spanning tree\n");
```

- Example
  - We would like to find a minimum cost spanning tree of the following graph.
  - We will denote this graph as G = (V, E)
  - The set of edges in the spanning tree is called T.
  - The set of vertices in the spanning tree is called TV.
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762121-f905d619-8eb2-4159-814f-0c6d1506c75c.png)
  
 - Initially, we select any vertex from G and insert to TV. T is empty.

- For all vertices not in TV, select a vertex v where 
  - (u,v)isinE
  - u is included in TV
  - among candidate edges that satisfy the condition, (u, v) is has the minimum cost

 - We repeat the process until T has n-1 edges.

- Time complexity of Prim's algorithm

 - An O(n2) implementation is possible using adjacent matrix (or an adjacency list.)

```c
static int fr[maxV];
#define P G->adj[v][w]
void GRAPHmstV(Graph G, int st[], double wt[]) {
  int v, w, min, n = G->V; for(v = 0; v < n; v++) {
    st[v] = -1; fr[v] = v; wt[v] = maxWT; 
  }
  wt[n] = maxWT;
  for(min = 0; min != n; ) {
    v = min; st[min] = fr[min]; for(w = 0, min = n; w < n; w++)
      if(st[w] == -1) {
        if(P < wt[w]) {
          wt[w] = P; fr[w] = v; 
        }
        if(wt[w] < wt[min]) min = w;
      }
  }
}
```



#### Time complexity of Prim's algorithm

- Using a priority queue, Prim's algorithm can be implemented so that its time complexity is O(e log n), which is the same as Kruskal's algorithm.

### 6.3.3 Sollin's algorithm

- Unlike Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm, Sollin's algorithm selects multiple edges for inclusion in T at each stage.
- At the start of a stage, the selected edges, together with all n graph vertices, form a spanning forest.
  - At initial stage, the set of selected edges is empty.

- During a stage, we select one edge for each tree in the forest. The edge is a minimum cost edge that has exactly one vertex in the tree.
  - If both vertices are in the tree, that would result in a cycle.

- Since two trees in the forest could select the same edge, we need to eliminate multiple copies of edges.
- The algorithm terminates when there is only one tree at the end of a stage or no edges remain for selection.

#### Example

- We would like to find a minimum cost spanning tree of the following graph.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762187-950eb7a2-fe3a-47d1-b701-315026ffad72.png)

- Initially, each vertex is a tree in the spanning forest.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762188-f8e27b07-d9f6-47f1-a441-70110b6a2f4b.png)

- For each tree, we select the minimum cost edge. Only one of the vertices of the edge should be in the tree.
  - The tree with vertex 0 chooses (0, 5)
  - The tree with vertex 1 chooses (1, 6)
  - The tree with vertex 2 chooses (2, 3)
  - The tree with vertex 3 chooses (3, 2)
  - The tree with vertex 4 chooses (4, 3)
  - The tree with vertex 5 chooses (5, 0)
  - The tree with vertex 6 chooses (6, 1)
  
- Duplicate edges (3, 2), (5, 0), (6, 1) are eliminated.

- We repeat the process
  - The tree with vertices 0 and 5 chooses (5, 4)
  - The tree with vertices 1 and 6 chooses (1, 2)
  - The tree with vertices 2, 3, and 4 chooses (2, 1)
  
- The duplicate edge (2, 1) is eliminated.

- Since we have a single tree, the algorithm terminates.
