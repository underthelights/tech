## Shortest Paths and Transitive Closure (Chapter 6.4)

- Suppose we have a graph that represents the highway system.
- In this graph, the vertices represent cities and edges represent sections of the highway
- Each edge has a weight representing the distance between the two cities connected by the edge.
- A motorist who wish to drive from city A to B will ask questions like: 
  - Is there a path from A to B?
  - If there is more than one path from A to B, which path is the shortest?
- We define the length of a path as the sum of the weights of the edges on that path.

### 6.4.1 Single Source/All Destinations: Nonnegative Edge Costs

- We are given the followings:
  - A directed graph G = (V, E)
  - A weighting function w(e) for the edges of G. (w(e) ≥ 0)
  - A source vertex. (vertex 1)
- Our goal is to determine a shortest path from vertex 1 to each of the remaining vertices of G.

#### Dijkstra's algorithm

- A greedy algorithm to calculate shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices.

##### example 1

- Each vertex maintains "distance" from the source vertex.
  - Initially, the distance of the source vertex is 0, while distance of all other vertices is set to infinity (a very large number).

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762262-cf8e9d83-6fab-4223-902a-53d33b784c8d.png)
  
- At each step of the algorithm we will extend SPT (shortest-path tree).

- At the 1st step, we include the source vertex to SPT.

- Then we update the distance to direct neighbors of the source vertex.

- At the 2nd step, we choose a vertice that is not yet included in SPT and has the minimum distance. This time it is vertex 2.

- We include vertex 2 in the SPT.

- Then, we update distance to adjacent vertices of vertex 2.
  - If a new path that passes through vertex 2 is shorter than the current distance, then the distance is updated.
  - Distance of vertex 3 is updated because d[2] + w(2,3) = 3 < d[3] = 4

- d[u] is the current distance from source vertex to u. w(e) is the weight of edge e.

- We repeat the same process.

- At the 3rd step, we choose vertex 3 and include it to SPT.

- Then, we update distance of adjacent vertices of vertex 3.

  - Distance of vertex 5 is updated to 6.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762300-f945079e-bcab-4bab-a78d-e70a46a13cee.png)

- We repeat the same process.

- At the 4th step, we choose vertex 5 and include it to SPT.

- Then, we update distance of adjacent vertices of vertex 5.
  - Distance of vertex 4 is updated to 8.
  - Distance of vertex 6 is updated to 11.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762310-f3f5055c-0a0a-4245-a77b-c9b09a5ca940.png)
  
- We repeat the same process.

- At the 5th step, we choose vertex 4 and include it to SPT.

- Then, we update distance of adjacent vertices of vertex 4.
  - Distance of vertex 6 is updated to 9.

- Finally all vertices are included in the SPT.

- The "length" column of the table has the length of the shortest path from the source vertex to each of the vertices.

##### example 2

- Find shortest path from vertex 0 to all other vertices.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762333-f237d1a7-4a8f-4231-89e8-5406fd1ec31e.png)

- Initially, SPT includes vertex 0.

- At this point, we can use only the incident edges of vertex 0.

- The distances to vertices are updated.

- We can see that vertex 3 has the shortest distance from vertex 0.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762345-c6df476d-4605-40f3-b09f-9a5188ddc6e8.png)

- We choose vertex 3 and include it in SPT.

- Then, we consider vertices where we have an edge from vertex 3.

- In this case, vertex 4 is the only one.

- We check whether we can get a shorter path to vertex 4. - This is called relaxation.

 - If $d[u]+w(u,v)<d[v]$, then $d[v]=d[u]+w(u,v)$

- We choose vertex 4 and include it in SPT.

- Then, we consider vertices where we have an edge from vertex 4.
  - vertex 1 and vertex 2 are candidates.

- We perform relaxation.
  - Distance to vertex 1 is updated to 45.
  - Distance to vertex 2 remains the same.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762348-c6656050-d3ca-45ab-a34b-244a1ed6dbc5.png)

- We choose vertex 1 and include it in SPT.

- Then, we consider vertices where we have an edge from vertex 1.
  - vertex 2 and vertex 3 are candidates.

- We perform relaxation.
  - The distances to vertices remain the same.

- We choose vertex 2 and include it in SPT.
- Then, we consider vertices where we have an edge from vertex 2.
  - vertex 4 is already visited, so there is no candidate for relaxation.
- Vertex 5 is next, but its distance is infinity. It means vertex 5 cannot be reached from vertex 0.

#### Single Source/All Destinations: Nonnegative Edge Costs [ex045]

```c
void shortestPath(int v, int cost[][MAX_VERTICES], int distance[], int n, short int found[]) {
  /* distance[i] represents the shortest path from v to i, cost is the adjacency matrix */
  int i, u, w;
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    found[i] = FALSE;
    distance[i] = cost[v][i];
  }
  found[v] = TRUE; distance[v] = 0;
  for(i = 0; i < n-2; i++) {
    u = choose(distance, n, found); found[u] = TRUE;
    for(w = 0; w < n; w++)
      if(!found[w])
        if(distance[u] + cost[u][w] < distance[w])
          distance[w] = distance[u] + cost[u][w];
  }
}

int choose(int distance[], int n, short int found[]) { 
  /* find the smallest distance not yet checked */
  int i, min, minpos;
  min = INT_MAX;
  minpos = -1;
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if(distance[i] < min && !found[i]) { 
      min = distance[i];
      minpos = i;
    }return minpos;
}
```

##### Analysis of Dijkstra's algorithm

- The first for loop in function shortestPath needs to be iterated n times.
- The second for loop in the function needs to be iterated n-2 times.
  - Inside the loop, calling function choose takes O(n), because it has a for loop.
  - After calling choose, there is a for loop which iterates n times.
- Thus, the total time complexity for this implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm is O(n2)

- Using heap, it is also possible to implement Dijkstra's algorithm in which the time complexity is O(e log n).

##### Applying Dijkstra's algorithm on undirected graphs

- We can simply convert the undirected graph to a directed graph by converting each undirected edge to two directed edges in either direction.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762392-76b3f069-9f64-4e97-a247-966c6b9fe099.png)

### 6.4.2 Single Source/All Destinations: General Weights 

- Dijkstra's algorithm only works when the edge weights are nonnegative.
- We now consider a single-source all-destinations shortest-path problem when negative edges are allowed.
- Although negative edges are allowed, the graph cannot have a negative cycle.
  - If there is a negative cycle, a path can become infinitely short by going through the cycle repeatedly.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762402-fcf1a6b1-41b9-4f77-901e-bbcab7a4552f.png)

#### Bellman-Ford Algorithm

- Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used to solve this problem.

- Let us first go through an example.

- In the following graph, we would like to find the shortest path from vertex 0 to all other vertices.

   - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762419-9f890bad-1998-4a34-8ce3-c158d674f940.png)

- Initially, the distance to the source vertex is zero, and the distance to all other vertices is infinity.

- In each stage of the algorithm, we perform relaxation on all edges.

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135762434-ffc4f47b-3c16-40ab-b1fb-00507de82e25.png)

- Suppose the order of edges in the adjacency list is:
   - (0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,4),(2,1),(2,4),(3,2),(3,5),(4,6),(5,6)
   
- We perform relaxation on each edge

- No update was made in this iteration.

- Then, this will be the answer.

- In the Bellman-Ford algorithm, we perform relaxation for every edge in each step.

- We repeat this step n-1 times.
  - At kth step, we at least obtain the shortest path from the source vertex to another vertex using k edges.

#### [ex046] - Pseudocode of Bellman-Ford algorithm

```c
void BellmanFord(int n, int v) {
  /* single source all destination shortest paths with negative edge weights. */
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    dist[i] = length[v][i];  /* initialize dist */
  for(int k = 2; k <= n-1; k++)
    for (each u such that u != v and u has at least one incoming edge)
      for(each <i, u> in the graph)
        if(dist[u] > dist[i] + length[i][u])
          dist[u] = dist[i] + length[i][u];
```

##### Time complexity of Bellman-Ford algorithm

- The outer for loop iterates for O(n) times.
- In the inner for loop, basically we need to traverse every node in the adjacency list, or every element in the adjacency matrix.
- If an adjacency list is used, it will take O(e) time.
- If an adjacency matrix is used, it will take O(n2) time.
- Thus, the total time complexity of Bellman-Ford algorithm is: - O(ne) or O(n3)



### 6.4.3 All Pairs Shortest Paths

- In the all-pairs-shortest-path problem, we must find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices.
- If the edge weights are nonnegative, we could run Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest paths from a single vertex to all other vertices.
- We can apply Dijkstra’s algorithm n times to obtain solution for the all-pairs- shortest-path problem. Since Dijkstra’s algorithm has $O(n^2)$ time complexity, it will take $O(n^3)$ to calculate all pairs shortest path.
- We have another solution for this problem called Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is still asymptotically O(n3) but in practice runs faster.
- Also, Floyd-Warshall algorithm works with negative edges as well.
  - Negative cycles are still disallowed.

- We represent the graph G by the cost adjacency matrix, cost\[ ][ ]. 

  - cost\[i][j]=0ifi==j
  - cost\[i][j] = inf (a very large number) if edge <i, j> is not in G.
  - cost\[i][j] = cost of edge <i, j> if <i, j> is in G.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135796649-cd909112-2872-44e3-929e-a8bec50f587a.png)

- Now we will define a matrix, Ak[][], that represents the length of shortest paths from a source vertex to a destination vertex.

- $A^k [i][j]$ is defined as the shortest path length from vertex i to vertex j, only taking vertices 1 through k as intermediate vertices.

  - $A^0[i][j]$ is the shortest path length from vertex i to j, where the path cannot include any intermediate vertex.
  - Thus, $A^0[][]$ is the same as the cost adjacency matrix.
    - In the example graph, we use 1 as the starting index for naming vertices. If we start at 0, the initial shortest path matrix should become $A^{-1}[][]$

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135796660-6041c5b2-b319-4447-975e-c8541da08dd9.png)

- From $A^0$, we make $A^1$.
  - $A^1[i][j]$ indicates length of the shortest path from i to j, where the path may include **vertex 1 as an intermediate vertex.**

  -  Suppose we consider a path from vertex 4 to 2.

  -  There is no edge <4, 2> in G, so $A^0[4][2]$ = inf.

  -  In A1, the path through vertex 1 is allowed. (4 → 1 → 2)
     - Its length is $A^0[4][1] + A^0[1][2]$
  -  If $A^0[4][1] + A^0[1][2]$ $< A^0[4][2], A^1[4][2]$ $= A^0[4][1] + A^0[1][2].$
  -  Otherwise, $A^1[4][2] = A^0[4][2]$
  -  In the example graph, $A^1[4][2] = A^0[4][1] + A^0[1][2] = 5$

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135797003-3d2e7ac6-ff99-4a47-85ed-31218164e46d.png)



- For each vertex pair (i, j), we perform relaxation.

  - If $A^0[i][j] > A^0[i][1] + A^0[1][j]$, $A^1[i][j] = A^0[i][1] + A^0[1][j]$
  - Otherwise, $A^1[i][j] = A^0[i][j]$

- Resulting A1 indicates the shortest paths where the paths can take only vertex 1 as an intermediate vertex.

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135797057-c7613ed2-9f51-4928-bc7a-e6fc41ec4ef4.png)

- From $A^1$, we make $A^2$.

  - For each vertex pair (i, j), we perform relaxation.
    - If $A^1[i][j] > A^1[i][2] + A^1[2][j]$,$A^2[i][j] = A^1[i][2] + A^1[2][j]$,
    - Otherwise, $A^2[i][j] = A^1[i][j]$

  - For example, let us consider the path from vertex 4 to 3.
    - $A^1[4][2]$ is the shortest path length from 4 to 2, possibly taking 1 as an intermediate.
    - $A^1[2][3]$ is the shortest path length from 2 to 3, possibly taking 1 as an intermediate.
    - Then, $A^1[4][2] + A^1[2$][3] is length of the path from 4 to 3, which passes through 2.
    - $A^1[4][3]$ is the length of the path from 4 to 3, which does not pass through 2.
    - Thus, minimum of the two is the shortest path from 4 to 3, possibly taking 1 and 2 as intermediates. 
    - $A^2[4][3] = min(A^1[4][3], A^1[4][2] + A^1[2][3])$

- From $A^2$, we make $A^3$.

  - For each vertex pair (i, j), we perform relaxation.

  - If $A^2[i][j] > A^2[i][3] + A^2[3][j]$, $A^3[i][j] = A^2[i][3] + A^2[3][j]$,
  - Otherwise, $A^3[i][j] = A^2[i][j]$

- From $A^3$, we make $A^4$.

  - For each vertex pair (i, j), we perform relaxation.
  - If $A^3[i][j] > A^3[i][4] + A^3[4$][j]$, $ $A^4[i][j] = A^3[i][4] + A^3[4][j]$
    - Otherwise, $A^4[i][j] = A^3[i][j]$

  - $A^4$ is our final answer, because it allows any vertex to become an intermediate vertex.

- Another example
  - Note that the initial matrix here is A-1 because the vertex index starts from 0.

#### [ex047] - Implementation of Floyd-Warshall algorithm

```c
void allCosts(int cost[][MAX_VERTICES], int distance[][MAX_VERTICES], int n) {
  int i, j, k;
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
    for(j = 0; j < n; j++)
      distance[i][j] = cost[i][j];
  for(k = 0; k < n; k++)
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for(j = 0; j < n; j++)
        if(distance[i][k] + distance[k][j] < distance[i][j])
          distance[i][j] = distance[i][k] + distance[k][j];
}
```

- Time complexity: $O(n^3)$. (triple nested for loop, $O(n)$ each).

### 6.4.4 Transitive Closure

- Suppose we have a directed graph G with unweighted edges.
 - Our goal is to determine if there's a path from i to j for all values of i and j.

- Definitions
  - The transitive closure matrix, denoted $A^+$, of a directed graph, G, is a matrix such that $A^+[i][j] = $1 if there is a path of length > 0 from i to j; otherwise, $A^+ [i][j] = 0$.
  - The reflexive transitive closure matrix, denoted $A^*$, of a directed graph, G, is a matrix such that $A^* [i][j] = 1$ if there is a path of length ≥ 0 from i to j; otherwise, $A^*[i][j] = 0$.
  - The only difference between the two is that the reflexive transitive closure matrix allows zero-length paths. Thus, $A^*[i][i]$ is always 1. On the other hand, $A^+[i][i]$ is 1 only when there is a cycle starting and ending at vertex i.

- Calculating A+
  - First, we assign 1 to all the edges in G.

    <img width="258" alt="image-20211004142031724" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135798316-13d16766-0457-4a7f-9a1e-ebaf7e78ecc8.png">

  - In the adjacency matrix, we let A[i][j] = inf if <i, j> is not in G. Otherwise, A[i][j]=1.

  - Then, we run Floyd-Warshall algorithm on G and obtain the "distance" matrix.

  - Then, we change all non-infinity values to 1, and change infinity to 0 to obtain A+.

  - From A+, we change all values in the diagonal to 1 to obtain A*.

- Implementation of Transitive Closure ($A^+$)
  - $cost[i][j] = 1$ when <i, j> is in G.
  - $cost[i][j] = 0$ otherwise.
- Time Complexity: $O(n^3)$ (same as allCosts)

```c
void transtiveClosure(int cost[][MAX_VERTICES], int distance[][MAX_VERTICES], int n) {
  int i, j, k;
  for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
    for(j = 0; j < n; j++)
      distance[i][j] = cost[i][j];
  for(k = 0; k < n; k++)
    for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for(j = 0; j < n; j++)
         distance[i][j] = distance[i][j] || (distance[i][k] && distance[k][j])
}
```
