## Queues (Chapter 3.3)

### Definition of Queue

- Similar to stack, queue is a specialized type of an ordered list.
- One end is called front.
- The other end is called rear (or back).
- Additions are done at the rear only.
- Removals are made from the front only.

### Queue: analogy 

- Bus stop
  - Elements are removed from the front of the queue.
  - Removing an element from a queue is called "dequeueing". 
  - Elements are removed from the front of the queue.
  - Removing an element from a queue is called "dequeueing".
  - New elements are inserted from the rear (back) of the queue.
  - Inserting a new element into the queue is called "enqueueing".

  
  
- Job scheduling in operating systems
  - non-priority scheduling: jobs are processed in the order they enter the system (FIFO behavior)
  - The operating system maintains a job queue in order to schedule jobs.

### Queue: FIFO behavior

- For a queue, the first element inserted to the queue is removed first.
- This type of behavior is called FIFO (First-In-First-Out).

### Queue: Abstract Data Type

```pseudocode
ADT Queue is

 objects : a finite ordered list with zero or more elements.
 
 functions : for all queue ∈ Queue, item ∈ element, maxQueueSize ∈ positive integer

Queue CreateQ(maxQueueSize) ::=
	create an empty queue whose maximum size is maxQueueSize

Boolean IsFullQ(queue, maxQueueSize) ::=
 if (number of elements in queue==maxQueueSize) return TRUE
 else return FALSE

queue AddQ(queue, item) ::=
 if (IsFullQ(queue)) queueFull
 else insert item at rear of queue and return 
 
Boolean IsEmptyQ(queue) ::= 
	if (queue == CreateQ(maxQueueSize)) return TRUE
	else return FALSE 

Element DeleteQ(queue) ::=
	if (IsEmptyQ(queue)) return
  else remove and return the item at front of queue.
```



### Queue: implementation

- We can use a one-dimensional array to represent a queue.
- We use two variables, front and rear, to indicate their positions in the array.
  - front points to the previous index of the first element.
  - If the first element is queue[0], then front is -1. Front is initialized to -1.
  - rear points to the index of the last element.
  - Initially, when the queue is empty, rear is initialized to -1.

```c
#define MAX_QUEUE_SIZE 100   
/* maximum queue size */
typedef struct {
  int key;
  /* other fields */
} element;
element queue[MAX_QUEUE_SIZE];
int rear = -1;
int front = -1;
```

#### Queue: implementation using an array[ex020]

- Adding an element to the queue
  - rear is incremented.
  - Then, the new element is stored at queue[rear].

```c
void addq(element item) {
  /* add an item to the queue */
  if(rear == MAX_QUEUE_SIZE-1)
    queueFull();
  queue[++rear] = item;
}
```

- Deleting an element from the queue
  - front is incremented.
  - Then, queue[front] is returned.

```c
element deleteq() {
  /* remove element at the front of the queue */
  if(front == rear)
    return queueEmpty();  /* return an error key */
  return queue[++front];
}
```



- Behavior of the queue implemented from an array
  - Whenever a new element is inserted, rear moves to the right.
  - Whenever an element is deleted, front moves to the right.

<img width="308" alt="image-20211003162024038" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751153-25d7a3ca-1b20-4e9b-a359-edfce2955ad5.png">

- The array has a limited capacity, so rear will eventually move to the last index.

  - rear becomes equal to MAX_QUEUE_SIZE - 1.

  - In this case, we need to reorganize the array in order to obtain spaces for newer

    elementse.

  - This is done by calling queueFull();

    - If the queue is truly full, then an error will occur because we cannot insert more elements to the queue.
    - If the queue has available spaces at the left of front, we should move the elements in the queue to the left to get more space for new elements.
    - The worst-case time complexity of queueFull is O(MAX_QUEUE_SIZE). In order to avoid this, a circular array is used.

#### Queue: implementation using a circular array

- Still using a one-dimension array, we can configure the array as a circular array.

- If the array holds three elements, following are the possible states of the array.

- Use integer variables front and rear.
  - front is one position counterclockwise from the first element 
  - rear is the position of the last element

- Adding an element
  - Move rear one position clockwise. 
  - Then put the new element into queue[rear].

- Removing an element
  - Move front one position clockwise.
  - Then extract the element from queue[front].

- Moving rear one position clockwise
  - capacity is the number of element spaces in the circular array.

```c
rear++;
if(rear == capacity) rear = 0;
```

- Problem when using a circular array
  - If(front==rear), we do not know whether the queue is full or empty.

- Solutions

  - Do not let the queue get full.
    - When the addition of an element will make the queue full, increase the size.

  - Define a Boolean variable last Operation Is AddQ.
    - Following each AddQ set this variable to true.
    - Following each DeleteQ set this variable to false. 
    - Queue is empty iff (front == rear) && !lastOperationIsAddQ 
    - Queue is full iff (front == rear) && lastOperationIsAddQ
  - Define an integer variable size.
    - Following each AddQ do size++.
    - Following each DeleteQ do size--.
    - Queue is empty iff (size == 0).
    - Queue is full iff (size == arrayLength).

- Adding an element to a queue using a circular array

```c
void addq(element item) {
  /* add an item to the queue */
  rear = (rear + 1) % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE;
  if(front == rear)
    queueFull();    /* print error and exit */
  queue[rear] = item;
}
```

- [ex021] Deleting an element from a queue using a circular array

```c
element deleteq() {
  /* remove element at the front of the queue */
  if(front == rear)
    return queueEmpty(); /* return a key indicating error */
  front = (front + 1) % MAX_QUEUE_SIZE;
  return queue[front];
}
```

- What are the time complexity of addq() and deleteq() when a circular array is used?
