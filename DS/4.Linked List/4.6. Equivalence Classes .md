## Equivalence Classes (Chapter 4.6)

### Equivalence Classes

- Definition from Wikipedia
  - In mathematics, when the elements of some set S have a notion of equivalence (equivalence relation) defined on them, then one may naturally split the set S into equivalence classes.

  
  
- Equivalence relation

  - An equivalence relation on a set X is a binary relation ~ on X satisfying the three properties
  - a ~ a for all a in X (reflexivity)
  - a ~ b implies b ~ a for all a and b in X (symmetry)
  - if a ~ b and b ~ c then a ~ c for all a, b, and c in X (transitivity)

  

- Examples
  - If X is the set of all cars, and ~ is the equivalence relation "has the same color as", then on particular equivalence class consists of all green cars.



- Suppose we have the following set of items, numbered from 0 to 11.
  - $S = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}$

- According to some equivalence relation, the following pairs of items are equivalent.
  - $(0, 4), (3, 1), (6, 10), (8, 9), (7, 4), (6, 8), (3, 5), (2, 11), (11, 0)$

- Then we can we can partition set S into the following equivalence classes.
  - $\{0, 2, 4, 7, 11\}$
  - $\{1, 3, 5\}$
  -  $\{6, 8, 9, 10\}$



- We are going to write a program that finds the equivalence classes from a set of items

- Input - number of items 
  - ex) 12 , 
  
  
- pairs of equivalent items
  - ex) $(0, 4), (3, 1), (6, 10), (8, 9), (7, 4), (6, 8), (3, 5), (2, 11), (11, 0)$

- Output - equivalence classes
  -  $0 2 4 7 11 / 1 3 5 / 6 8 9 10$

#### Algorithm for finding equivalence classes

- Input: 
- $(0, 4), (3, 1), (6, 10), (8, 9), (7, 4), (6, 8), (3, 5), (2, 11), (11, 0)$
- First Phase
  - For each item i, we store all items j that have direct equivalence relationship given by the input.

- Second Phase

  - For 0, we search for all items equivalent with 0. 

  - Since 4 and 11 are equivalent with 0, we need to also search for all items equivalent with 4 and 11 as well.

  - Since 7 is equivalent with 4, we need to also search for items equivalent with 7.

  - If we find all items equivalent to 0, then we have found one equivalence class.

  - Then we go to the next item which is not chosen in any equivalence class yet, and do the samething.

#### Implementation

- We are going to use an array of linked lists.
  - One linked list for each item.
- After the first phase, we will have the following structure.

- In the second phase, we need to find all equivalent items of item 0.

- Then, we should search for equivalent classes of 11 and 4.

- For this purpose, we are going to use a stack.

  - When processing the linked list of item 0, we put 11 and 4 into the stack.

  - After we are done with 0, we pop an item from the stack. We get 11.

  - We process equivalent items of 11. 

  - Since 0 is already processed, we skip 0.

  - Since 2 is not processed yet, we include 2 in the equivalence class and also put 2 into the stack.

  - When the stack is empty, we have completed an equivalence class.

  - Then we go to the next item that is not processed yet.

#define MAX_SIZE 24
#define FALSE 0

struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *link;
};
typedef struct node *nodePointer;

void main() {
    short int out[MAX_SIZE];
    nodePointer seq[MAX_SIZE];
    nodePointer x, y, top;
    int i, j, n;
    printf("Enter the size (<= %d) ", MAX_SIZE);
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        /* initialize seq and out */ out[i] = TRUE;
        seq[i] = NULL;
    }

    /* phase 1: input the equivalence pairs */
    printf("Enter a pair of numbers (-1 -1 to quit): ");
    scanf("%d%d", &i, &j);
    while (i >= 0) {
        x = (nodePointer) malloc(sizeof(*x));
        x->data = j;
        x->link = seq[i];
        seq[i] = x;
        x = (nodePointer) malloc(sizeof(*x));

        x->link = seq[j];
        seq[j] = x;
        printf("Enter a pair of numbers (-1 -1 to quit): ");
        scanf("%d%d", &i, &j);
    }
    /* phase 2: output the equivalence classes */
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (out[i]) {
            printf("\nNew class: %5d", i);
            out[i] = FALSE;
            x = seq[i];
            top = NULL;
            for (;;) {
                while (x) {
                    j = x->data;
                    if (out[j]) {
                        printf("%5d", j);
                        out[j] = FALSE;
                        y = x->link;
                        x->link = top;
                        top = x;
                        x = y;
                    } else x = x->link;
                }
                if (!top) break;
                x = seq[top->data];
                top = top->link;
            }
        }
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```



#### Analysis

- m : number of pairs in the input.n : number of items.

- Phase 1

  - Initialization of seq and out takes O(n) time.
- Inputting equivalence pairs takes O(m) time.
  - Total time in phase 1 : O(m + n)

  

- Phase 2

  - The outer for loop is repeated n times.O(n).
  - Inside, each node in the array of linked list structure is processed once.Since there are 2m nodes, the time required is O(m).
  - Total time in phase 2 : O(m + n)

  

- The time complexity of the program for finding equivalence classes : O(m + n)



- Space complexity : O(m + n)

  - n entries in the array of node pointers

  - 2m nodes in the linked list structure
