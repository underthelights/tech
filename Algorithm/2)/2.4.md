# 2.4. PQ 2: Min-Max Heap

- Problem
  - The following operations must be performed as mixed in data processing:
    - Store a record with a key in an arbitrary order. 
    - Fetch the record with the current largest key. 
    - Fetch the record with the current smallest key.

- A solution
  - Design a data structure that offers the efficient implementation of the following operations (Double-Ended Priority Queue):
    - Insert an element with an arbitrary key. 
    - Delete an element with the largest key. 
    - Delete an element with the smallest key.


- $ref.$ [Horowitz 9.1]
