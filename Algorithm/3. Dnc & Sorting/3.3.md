## 3. Master Theorem 

### Master Theorem 1

- [Neapolitan 2.8]
- Let a, b, and c be nonnegative constants. 
- The solution to the recurrence $T (1)=1$, and $T(n)=aT(n/c)+bn$, for $n>1$for $n$ a power of $ c$ is
  - 1. $T(n)=O(n)$, if $a<c$ 
    2. $T(n)=O(nlogn)$, if $a=c$ 
    3. $T(n) = O(nlogca)$, if $a > c$
- Prove this by induction!
- Avoid divided-and-conquer if, for exampleâ€“
  - An instance of size n is divided into two or more instances each almost of size n.
  - An instance of size n is divided into almost n instance of size n/c, where c is a constant.
- The divide-and-conquer strategy often leads to efficient algorithms, although not always!
