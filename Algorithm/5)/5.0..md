- Branch-and-Bound Method
- Etc.


# 1. The Greedy Method

- A technique to follow the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage.

- Strategy
  - Make the choice that appears best at each moment!
  - It is hoped to arrive at a globally optimal solution by making a locally optimal choice.


- Pros and cons
  - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)
  - Simple and straightforward to design an algorithm.
  - Does not guarantee the optimal solution to all problems 
    - Local maximum versus global maximum
