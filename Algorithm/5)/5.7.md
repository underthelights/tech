# 5.7. Scheduling with Deadlines

## Problem
  - Let $J = \{1, 2, ..., n\}$ be a set of jobs to be served. 
  - Each job takes one unit of time to finish.
  - Each job has a **deadline and a profit**.
    - If the job starts before or at its deadline, the profit is obtained.
  - Schedule the jobs so as to **maximize** the total profit (not all jobs have to be scheduled).

### Example:

  <!-- | Schedule | Total Profit |
  | -------- | ------------ |
  | [1, 3]   | 30 + 25 = 55 |
  | [2, 1]   | 35 + 30 = 65 |
  | [2, 3]   | 35 + 25 = 60 |
  | [3, 1]   | 25 + 30 = 55 |
  | [4, 1]   | ☞ 40+30=70   |
  | [4, 3]   | 40 + 25 = 65 |-->

<!-- | Job  | Deadline | Profit |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| 1    | 2        | 30     |
| 2    | 1        | 35     |
| 3    | 2        | 25     |
| 4    | 1        | 40     | -->

## A greedy approach
  - Sort the jobs in **non-increasing** order by profit.
  - Scan each job in the sorted list, adding it to the schedule if possible.

### Example
  - S = EMPTY
  - Is S = {1} OK? 
    - Yes: S $\leftarrow$ {1} ([1])
  - Is S = {1, 2} OK? 
    - Yes: S $\leftarrow$ {1, 2} ([2, 1])
  - Is S = {1, 2, 3} OK? 
    - No.
  - Is S = {1, 2, 4} OK?
    - Yes: S $\leftarrow$ {1, 2, 4} ([2, 1, 4] or [2, 4, 1])
  - Is S = {1, 2, 4, 5} OK? 
    - No.
  - Is S = {1, 2, 4, 6} OK? 
    - No.
  - Is S = {1, 2, 4, 7} OK? 
    - No.

## Implementation Issues
- A key operation in the greedy approach
  - Determine if a set of jobs $S$ is feasible.
  - Fact
    - S is feasible if and only if the sequence obtained by ordering the jobs in $S$ according to nondecreasing deadlines is feasible.
  - Example
    - Is $S = \{1, 2, 4\}$ OK?→$[2(1), 1(3), 4(3)]$→Yes!
    - Is $S = \{1, 2, 4, 7\}$ OK?→$[2(1), 7(2), 1(3), 4(3)]$→No
- An $O(n^2)$implementation
  - Sort the jobs in non-increasing order by profit. 
  - For each job in the sorted order,
    - See if the current job can be scheduled together with the previously selected jobs, using a linked list data structure.
      - If yes, add it to the list of feasible sequence.
      - Otherwise, reject it.
  - Time complexity
    - $O(n \log n) + \Sigma_{i=2}^{n}{\{(i-1)+i\}} = O(n^2)$
    - When there are $i-1$ jobs in the sequence,
      - at most $i-1$ comparisons are needed to add a new job in the sequence, and
      - at most $i$ comparisons are needed to check if the new sequence is feasible.
- Is the time complexity always $O(n^2)$? 
  - What if $n >> d_{max}$?
    - $O(n \log n+n d_{max})$
  - What if $n >> d_{max}$ and $n >> k_{scanned}$?
    - $O(n + k_{scanned} \log n + k_{scanned} d_{max}) = O(n)$ 
    - Is this complexity achievable when a max heap data structure is employed

## Correctness of the Greedy Method
- Left as an exercise.
