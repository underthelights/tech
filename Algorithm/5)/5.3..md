# 5.3. Huffman’s Algorithm 

## 1. Contents

- Idea
  - Put the rarest characters at the bottom of the tree.

- A **greedy** approach
  - Repeat the following until only one tree is left:
    1. Start from a set of single node trees.
    2. Pick up two trees $u$ and $v$ with **the lowest frequencies**.
    3. Merge them by adding a root node w where the frequency of the new node is the sum of those of $u$ and $v$.
    4. Replace $u$ and $v$ by $w$.

## 2. Implementation and Time Complexity 

- **Implementation issues**
  - How can you manage a dynamic set to which the following operations occur frequently:
    - Delete the elements with the highest priority from the list. 
    - Insert an element with some priority into the list.
    - **The answer is to use Priority Queue.**

  - The priority queue can be implemented in many ways. Which one would you use?

    | Representation        | Insertion    | Deletion     |
    | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
    | Unordered array       | $O(1)$       | $O(n)$     |
    | Unordered linked list | $O(1)$       | $O(n)$     |
    | Sorted array          | $O(n)$    | $O(1)$       |
    | Sorted linked list    | $O(n)$     | $O(1)$       |
    | Heap                  | $O(\log n)$ | $O(\log n)$ |

- **✓ The answer is to use the priority queue based on (min) heap.**

- **→ $O (n\log n)$ time**
  - insert the n single-node trees : $O(n)$
  - $\log n + \log (n-1) + ... + \log(2) = \log n! = O (n \log n)$
  
  ```c++
  typedef struct _node
  {
      char symbol;
      int freq;
      struct _node left;
      struct _node right;
  } NODE;
  NODE u, v, w;

  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) // O(n)
  {
      /* insert the n single-node trees */
  }
  for (i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++)
  {
      u = PQ_delete();
      v = PQ_delete();
      w = make_a_new_node();
      w->left = u;
      w->right = v;
      w->freq = u->freq + v->freq;
      PQ_insert(w);
  }
  w = PQ_delete();
  /* w points to the optimal tree. */
  ```

## 3. Correctness of the Huffman’s Algorithm

- siblings, branch
- **(Proof by mathematical induction)**
  - If the set of trees obtained in the $i$-th step are branches in a binary tree corresponding to an optimal code, then the set of trees obtained in the $(i+1)$st step are also branches in a binary tree corresponding to an optimal code.

  - Optimal binary tree

  - $i$-th step

  - $\rightarrow (i+1)$-th step

  - **(Base step)** When $k = 0$, each tree is trivially a branch of an optimal tree.

  - **(Induction step)** Suppose that the proposition is true when $k = i$, that $S$ is the set of trees that exist after the $i$th step, and that $T$ is the corresponding optimal tree. Let $u$ and $v$ be the root of the trees combined in the $(i+1)$st step.

  - Case 1: If $u$ and $v$ are siblings in $T$, we are done.

  - Case 2: Otherwise, assume that $u$ is at a level in $T$ at least as low as $v$, and that $w$ is the $u$’s sibling in $T$.

    - The branch in $T$ with root $w$ is one of the trees in S or contains one of those trees as a subtree.
      - why?
    - Therefore, $freq(w) ≥ freq(v)$ and $depth(w) ≥ depth(v)$ in $T$
    - If we create a new tree $T’$ by swapping the two branches with root $v$ and $w$, then $bits(T’) = bits(T) + (depth(w) – depth(v))(freq(v) – freq(w)) ≤ bits(T)$.
    - Since $bits(T) ≤ bits(T’), T’$ is also optimal. Hence, the proposition also holds when $k = i+1$.

  - What happens if all the steps are done?
