# 5.8. Data Structures for Disjoint Sets 

- [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure)

- Partition
  - A partition of a set $X$ is a set of non-empty subsets of $X$ such that every element x in $X$ is in exactly one of these subsets.
  - Example: $X = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}→\{ \{1, 3, 5\}, \{2\}, \{4, 6\} \}$

- Disjoint-set data structure (union-find data structure)
  - Used to effectively manage a collection of subsets that partition a given set of elements.

- Basic operations on disjoint sets
  - `Makeset(x)`
    - Make a set containing only the given element x.
  - `S = Find(x)`
    - Determine which set the particular element x is in.
      - Typically return an element that serves as the subset’s representative.
      - May be used to determine if two elements are in the same subset.
  - `Union(x, y)` (or Merge(x, y))
    - Merge two subsets into a single subset.

- Applications 
  - **Tracking the connected components of an undirected graph**
    - Decide if two vertices belong to the same component, or if adding an edge between them would result in a cycle.
    - Useful for implementing **the Kruskal’s algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree**

- **Scheduling with deadlines**
- Computing shorelines of a terrain
- Classifying a set of atoms into molecules or fragments. 
- Connected component labeling in image analysis


- Example
  - $U=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$
  -  For (each $x$ $\in$ $U$) 
     - Makeset($x$); → {$a$}, {$b$}, {$c$}, {$d$}, {$e$} 
     - Union($a$, $c$); → {$a$, $c$}, {$b$}, {$d$}, {$e$}
     - {a, c} = Find(a);
     - Union($c$, $e$); → {$a$, $c$, $e$}, {$b$}, {$d$} 

- Implementation of disjoint sets using reversed trees 

  - Makeset(x)
    ```c++
    Makeset(x){
    	parent(x) := x
    	rank(x) := 0
    }
    ```
    - **Time complexity:** $O(1)$

- Two ways of implementing the Union Operation
  - **Time complexity:** $O(n)$

  - **Time complexity:** $O(\log n)$

- **Union by rank**

  - Always attach the smaller tree to the root of the larger tree.
  - The **rank** increases by one only if two trees of the same rank are merged.
    - The rank of a one-element tree is zero.
  - The Union and Find operations can be done in $O(\log n)$ in the worst case.
    - The number of elements in a tree of rank $r$ is at least $2^r$ (Proof by induction)
    - The maximum possible rank of a tree with n elements is $O(\log n)$.

- `S = Find(x)`

  - **Time complexity**: $O(depth of x in the tree)$
    ```c++
    Find(x) {
      if (x == parent(x))
        return x 
      else
        return Find(parent(x)) 
    }
    Find(x) {
      while (x != parent(x))
        x := parent(x)
      return x
    }
    ```

- `Union(x, y)`

  - **Time complexity:** 2 Find op’s + $O (1)$
    ```c++
    Union(x, y) { 
      x0 := Find(x) 
      y0 := Find(y) 
      if (x0 == y0)
        return
      if (rank(x0) > rank(y0))
        parent(y0) := x0
      else
        parent(x0) := y0
      if (rank(x0) == rank(y0))
        rank(y0) := rank(y0)+1
    }
    ```



## Another Algorithm Based on Disjoint Sets

- Method
  - $d_{max}$ : the maximum of the deadlines for $n$ jobs.
  - Add a job as late as possible to the schedule being built, but no later than its deadline.

  - Sort the jobs in non-increasing order by profit.
  - Initialize $d_{max}+1$ disjoint sets, containing the integers $0, 1, 2, ..., d_{max}$
  - For each job in the sorted order,
    - Find the set $S$ containing the minimum of its deadline and $n$.
      - If $small(S) = 0$, reject the job.
      - Otherwise, schedule it at time $small(S)$, and merge $S$ with the set containing $small(S)-1$.

- Time complexity
  - $O(n \log m)$ for the disjoint set manipulation, where $m$ is the minimum of $n$ and $d_{max}$
  - $O(n \log n)$ for sorting the profits.
