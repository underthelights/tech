### 1) Huffman Coding

- Data compression
  - Data compression can save storage space for files.
  - Huffman coding is just one of many data compression techniques.


- Problem
  - Given a file, find a binary character code for the characters in the file, which represents the file in the **least** number of bits.


- Example
  - Original text file: `ababcbbbc`
  - Huffman codes:$a=10,b=0,c=11$ 
  - â†’ Compressed file: $1001001100011$
  
  - Is it possible to have a code set where $a = 01, b = 0, and c = 11$?
