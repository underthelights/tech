# A Variety of Priority Queue Implementations

- [Priority Queue 1: Max(Min) Heap]
- [Priority Queue 2: Min-Max Heap]
- [Priority Queue 3: Heap and Hashing]
- [Priority Queue 4: Deap]
- [Priority Queue 5: Leftist Tree]
- [Priority Queue 6: Binomial Heap]
- [Priority Queue 7: Fibonacci Heap]

# [Job Scheduling Example: Priority Queue]

- Consider the following sequence of requests in an operating system:

## Requirement 1

- CPU executes the process with the highest priority first.
- Use a heap structure â€“ a simple max heap :)

  ```c++
  typedef struct _process {
    int proc_id; 
    char *owner; 
    int priority;
  } Process;

  static Process *_proc_heap; 
  static int _proc_heap_size = 0; 
  static int _proc_heap_ptr = 0;

  int PH_create(int n);        
  int PH_full();
  int PH_empty();
  int PH_insert(Process item);
  int PH_delete(Process *item);
  ```

## Requirement 2

- The priority of processes can be modified after they are placed in the priority queue.

  ```c++
  int H_change_priority(int proc_id, int new_priority);
  ```

  - This function requires locating a particular process in the heap, but the basic heap operations provide no efficient way to do it.

  - Employ an auxiliary data structure such as a hash table that keeps track of the location of each process in the heap structure.

- Once the two requirements are satisfied, the operating system can process the following basic commands efficiently:

  ```assembly
  INSERT  <proc_id>  <owner>  <priority>
  DELETE
  CHANGEPR <proc_id> <new_priority> PRINTHEAP
  END
  ```
