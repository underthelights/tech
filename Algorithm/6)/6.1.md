# 1. Definitions

- An **(undirected, simple) graph** G is defined to be a pair of $(V, E)$ , where $V$ is a non-empty finite set of elements called **vertices**, and E is a finite set of unordered pairs of distinct elements of V called **edges**.
  - $G = (V, E) = (V(G), E(G))$
  - Graphs that allow loops and multiple edges are often called a **general graphs**.
- A (simple) digraph $D$ is defined to be a pair $(V, A)$, where $V$ is a non-empty finite set of elements called **vertices**, and A is a finite set of ordered pairs of distinct elements of V called **(directed) edges** or **(directed) arcs**.
- A **weighted graph** is a graph in which a number, called the **weight**, is assigned to each edge.


$V = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$
$\\ E = \{ (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6) \}$

From Wikipedia

- A **subgraph** of a graph $G$ is simply a graph, all of whose vertices belong to $V(G)$ and all of whose edges belong to $E(G)$.

## Adjacency and incidence
  - Two vertices $v$ and $w$ of a graph $G$ are said to be **adjacent** if there is an edge joining them.
  - Two distinct edges of $G$ are **adjacent** if they have at least one vertex in common.
  - The **vertices** $v$ and $w$ are then said to be incident to such an edge.
  - The **degree** of a vertex $v$ of $G$ is the number of edges incident to $v$.

## **Walk, trail, circuit, path, and cycle**
  
  > The definitions differ by various textbooks!!!

  - A **walk** (or **edge-sequence**) is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges, starting and ending at a vertex, in which each edge is adjacent in the sequence to its two endpoints.

  - The **length** of a walk is the number of edges in it.

  - A **trail** is a walk in which all the edges are distinct from one another.

  - A **walk** is closed if it starts and ends at the same vertex.

  - A **circuit** is a trail that is closed.

  - A **path** is a walk in which all the vertices are distinct from one another.

  - A **cycle** is a path containing at least one edge with an exception that the first and last vertices coincide.

  - An **Eulerian trail** is a trail that visits every edge exactly once.

  - An **Eulerian circuit** is an Eulerian trail that starts and ends on the same vertex.

  - A **Hamiltonian path** is a path that visits each vertex exactly once. 

  - A **Hamiltonian cycle** is a Hamiltonian path that is a cycle.

    -  An Eulerian circuit exists in a connected graph $G$ if the degree of every vertex is even, and can be found in $O(|E|)$ time.
    -  Determining whether such paths and cycles exist in graphs is the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete.

## Examples of graphs
  - A **null graph** is a graph whose edge-set is empty.
  - A **regular graph** is a graph in which each vertex has the same degree.
  - A **complete graph** is a graph in which each pair of vertices is joined by an edge.
  - A **bipartite graph** is a graph in which its vertex set can be partitioned into two sets $V_1$ and $V_2$, in such a way that every edge of the graph joins a vertex of $V_1$ to a vertex of $V2$.
  - A **connected graph** is an undirected graph, in which, given any pair of vertices $v$ and $w$, there is a path from $v$ to $w$.
    - An arbitrary graph can split up into disjoint connected subgraphs called **connected components**.
  - A **tree** is a connected graph with no cycles.
  - A **forest** is a graph with no cycles.

- Graph isomorphism
  - Two graphs $G1$ and $G2$ are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between the vertices of $G1$ and those of $G2$ with the property that the number of edges joining any two vertices of $G1$ is equal to the number of edges joining the corresponding vertices of $G2$.

  = (A[i] + j)
  = ((A + i))[j]
  = (((A + i)) + j)
  = (&A[0][0] + 5i + j)
