# 6.4.1. Minimum Spanning Trees

- Tree
  - A tree is a connected graph T that contains no cycle. 
  - Other equivalent statements ($T = (V, E)$ where $|V| = n$)
  - $T$ contains no cycles, and has $n-1$ edges.
  - $T$ is connected, and has $n-1$ edges.
  - Any two vertices of $T$ are connected by exactly one path.
  - $T$ contains no cycles, but the addition of any new edge creates exactly one cycle.

- Forest
  - A forest is a graph with no cycles.

- Buy-Two-Get-One-Free Theorem
  - For a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices, any two of the following three properties imply the third one:
    1. $G$ is connected. 
    2. $G$ is acyclic.
    3. $G$ has $n-1$ edges.

- Minimum spanning tree
  - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)
  - A **spanning tree** for a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a tree that contains all the vertices of $G$.
  - The **cost** of a spanning tree of a weighted graph $G = (V, E)$ is the sum of the weights of the edges in the spanning tree.
  - A **minimum spanning tree** for a weighted graph $G = (V, E)$ is a spanning tree of least cost.

- Problem
  - Given a weighted graph $G = (V, E)$, find a minimum spanning tree of $G$.

- A naiÌˆve approach
  - Examine all the spanning trees of $G$, and take one having least cost.
  - There are $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees in $K_n$!
