# 4.1. Dynamic Programming: Overview

- From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming): Dynamic programming is both a 
  - mathematical optimization method and 
  - a computer programming method.


- A complicated problem is **broken down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner**.


- Overlapping subproblems
    - A problem is broken down into subproblems which are reused several times or a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblem over and over rather than always generating new subproblems.


- Optimal substructure
    - A solution to a given optimization problem can be constructed efficiently from optimal solutions of its subproblems.


- When applicable, the method **takes far less time than other methods** that don't take advantage of the subproblem overlap **like the divide- and-conquer technique**.
